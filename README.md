🎓 Data Analysis and Visualization Lab Task 📊
 📌 Objective: This repository showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization task using Python. The project highlights the application of regular expressions (RE), NumPy, Matplotlib, and NetworkX to gain insights from a dataset.

📂 Steps and Methodology: 📥 Data Loading:

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing data and ensured consistency by filling missing values.

Utilized regular expressions to extract relevant information from text fields, such as contact numbers.

📊 Statistical Analysis with NumPy:

Performed statistical analysis on numeric columns, calculating metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data distribution.

🌍 Geospatial Visualization:

Created geospatial visualizations using Matplotlib to plot locations based on Latitude and Longitude, revealing geographic patterns in the dataset.

📈 Program Distribution Visualization:

Visualized the distribution of PROGRAM TYPE and Grade Level/Age Group using bar charts and pie charts, providing insights into the variety and focus of programs.

🔗 Network Analysis with NetworkX:

Constructed a network graph to represent relationships between BOROUGH/ COMMUNITY and AGENCY.

Enhanced the network graph visualization using customized node sizes and colors, making the connections clearer and more informative.

📊 Insights and Findings: 🧼 Data Cleaning: Successfully addressed missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.

📉 Statistical Analysis: Provided key statistical metrics to understand the distribution of geographic data.

🗺️ Geospatial Patterns: Identified spatial patterns in the dataset through geospatial visualizations.

📊 Program Distribution: Offered insights into the variety and age focus of programs through visual distribution analysis.

🔗 Network Relationships: Highlighted the connections between different boroughs/communities and agencies, uncovering key relationships within the dataset.

🏁 Conclusion: This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The repository includes all code, visualizations, and findings, serving as a valuable resource for those interested in data science and its applications.
